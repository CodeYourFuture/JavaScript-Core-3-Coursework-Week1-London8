# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

ESLint is what is called an static analysis tool. It checks your code for common mistakes that can impact code quality and styling. 

If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

*  You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
*  You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

- [Lessons in problem solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)
- [Computational thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbnTZCj0ugI)

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

I think that the most important skill a good programmer should possess is computational thinking. It lets a programmer think or imagine how a computer thinks and what should be passed to the computer to make it understand our idea and our code.


## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

When you are having a big challenge to solve you should first try to visualize and understand the problem you are approaching and then break it down to smaller challenges to find a solution for those first as you can use it in the further work on the solution for the bigger problem.


## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

When stuck, the first thing could be using the ‘rubber duck’ technique or any other that would let you visualize and say out loud what the problem is and what is your plan of solving it in as simple words as possible. This makes it understandable and helps to find the moment where the problem solving approach we chose is failing and how to fix it. Google research and help from other programmers is also very handy and significant.
