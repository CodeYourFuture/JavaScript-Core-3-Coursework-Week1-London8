# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

ESLint is what is called an static analysis tool. It checks your code for common mistakes that can impact code quality and styling.

If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

- You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
- You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

I suppose before af all programer must first be an optimistic person, even when you facing very difficult problems, he/she must be in the mode that he/she can solve it today and tomorrow. The presence of logic thinking ability shows the programmer how qualified he/she is.
Programmer a person who can use time well and works organized.

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

I want to share my own experiences. When I am doing project and it didn't give what I expect or it had a bug,
-first thing I am doing relaxing just relax don't panic,
-after try to read code step by step, console log it to see what is happening on each step,

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

-and then nothing could find google is your best friend, trying to find same errors as mine, stackoverflow.com is the my favorite site which I go first,or anything else
-if you have friend or colleague who might help with your problem then ask them
-if haven't solve your problem then make some coffee or tea or just give a rest, or if it is evening time sleep well and take a look tomorrow with fresh mind it will look much more different then now
-but if don't have time and you have lots of works then do another work and try problem solving after!
