# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

ESLint is what is called an static analysis tool. It checks your code for common mistakes that can impact code quality and styling. 

If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

*  You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
*  You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

- [How to THINK like a programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNazO2tMHno)
- [Lessons in problem solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)
- [Computational thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbnTZCj0ugI)

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- Write your answer here 

The ability to solve problems! 

Practice the below answers over and over again on a daily basis or as often as possible. More so the
problem solving rather than the direct coding itself. Doing math problems or puzzles(e.g. sudoku) or working 
on algorithms and understanding them. 

Apply the computational thinking process:
Using the following steps: 
1 -> Decomposition - breaking a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts.
2 -> Pattern recognition - identify patterns/trends in a pattern
3 -> Abstraction - identify specific similarities/differences among similar problems to work toward a solution.
4 -> Algorithm - developing step by step instructions for solving a problem

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- Write your answer here 

Have your own framework. 

Understand the problem as opposed to just diving in and trying a few solutions without understanding it properly.
Draw some type of user interface/diagram, as it helps to visualise what you're working on. Or use the rubber duck approach and 
talk to it and explain the problem (talking out loud). 

Think of bugs/errors as a challenge not an annoyance because you can learn from it.

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- Write your answer here 

Divide the problem into smaller problems. It makes it less intimidating and you feel more likely to complete
the tasks bit by bit. Break it down like a math problem and take it a step at a time as each step is its own 
task in itself with its own purpose of solving the product. 

If you get stuck and can't figure it out still, then comment out what you've done so far, so you have it as a
reference and you can start over but still have those references to refer to later if you need.
