# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

ESLint is what is called an static analysis tool. It checks your code for common mistakes that can impact code quality and styling.

If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

- You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
- You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

The most important quality for a programmer is the ability to understand and solve problems.

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

When trying to solve a challenge, you should analyse the problem. Once you have analysed the problem, you need to think about the steps you need to take to solve it.

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

If you get stuck, you should keep calm and avoid getting frustrated.

The first thing you need to do is debug the problem and see where you can get it right. If you are unable to solve a problem, you need to break the solution down and see where you have been wrong. If something doesnâ€™t feel right in your solution, start over and try again with a different approach. If you still get stuck, try to do some research about the problem or potential solutions.

If you still feel stuck, you must ask for help from you peers.
